<h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Deep Learning system that helps health workers, especially nurses to detect severence level of wounds.</h4> 
<h3>Abstracts:</h3>
<p>The increment of active COVID-19 patients in Indonesia since 2020 makes demand for health workers keep increasing. This caused a lot of problems, especially in the wound assessment field. The standardization of wound healing level assessment is still not available so health workers, especially nurses have to use their sense of sight to detect wound healing level. An integrated sytem is pivotal for nurses to be able to detect wound healing level effectively and accurately. This benefits not only for nurses,  but also for patients since effective and accurate wound healing level classification gives the best wound treatment for patients. The purpose of this project is to make device that could detect would healing level using image processing with convolutional neural network classification method, which gives 3 output, normal level wound, a bit severe wound, and extremely severe wound. </p>
<p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for this project since CNN model gives out the best 	accuracy value in testing phase rather than other neural network model in Machine Learning, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest.</p>
